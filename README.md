# Homefitness-Ja
For our project we designed a workout fitness application. We designed this application for the web based platform.This application allows the user to monitor their workout performances and Recommend Excersises.We also incorperate Pose Estimation, where users can be informed about specific areas to help in working out correctly.
# Excersise Recommendation
We propose an exercises recommendation algorithm which uses model-free reinforcement learning with neural network function approximation to learn an exercise recommendation policy. The policy directly operates on raw observations of a student's exercise history. Experimental results show that our policy achieves better performance than existing heuristic policy in terms of maximizing students' knowledge level.
# Pose Estimation
Human pose estimation is a popular solution that AI has to offer; it is used to determine the position and orientation of the human body given an image containing a person.At the core of any human pose estimation application lies a pose estimation algorithm that receives an image of a person as an input and outputs the coordinates of the specific keypoints or landmarks on the human body (XY coords in 2D pose estimation or XYZ coords in 3D pose estimation).

### TODO Update:
- [ ] Conenct the componets and design frontend responses 
- [ ] Models creation
- [ ] Reption Counter
- [ ] Launch and Test Website
- [ ] Report
- [ ] Website

### TODO
- [ ] fucntion for to calculate angle betwen points
- [ ] label each video frame for biceps curls,shoulder press,pushup
- [ ] We need a functions fi calculate the number of reps for each exercise base on the angles
- [ ] find the key points for each workout
      - [ ] isolate those frames 
- [ ] a neural network to classify the kepponts and angles
